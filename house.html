    <p>
      I am what some describe as a "minimalist" where as I just like to think of
      my living choices as voluntary simplicity. My dream home would be almost
      barn like with an open floor plan (I hate closed in spaces) for kitchen,
      living and dining areas. This would all be on a property that would enable
      me to grow my own fruits and vegetables and keep bees as well as raising
      some chickens for fresh eggs.
